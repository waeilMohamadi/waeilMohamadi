I am a full-stack Java software developer with recent experience building multi-tiered web applications. I went to school at Texas Southern University where I pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science . In a few years, my goal is to become a senior developer and have my own IT company.

During my time at Revature, I’ve worked on several projects where I gained experience in both backend technologies (including Java, SQL, Spring framework, and microservice architecture) as well as frontend development (including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Angular). I also have experience with DevOps and using CI/CD pipelines, deploying to the AWS cloud. I really enjoy collaborative team environments where I can learn from others, and I have worked hard to improve my interpersonal and communication skills.  I look forward to applying all of my skills and prior experience in a position on your team.
