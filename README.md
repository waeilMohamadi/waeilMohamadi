Education and  Revature Journey 
================================
I graduated from Texas Southern University College of Science && Engineering Batchelor of Computer science year 2019.
after I finished my School i apllied into many Companies and all of them they want to hire me but unfortunately i did not have any experience or internship.
untill i found Revature Company.

During my time at Revature, I’ve worked on several projects where I gained experience in both backend technologies 
(including Java, SQL, Spring framework, and microservice architecture) as well as frontend development (including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Angular).
I also have experience with DevOps and using CI/CD pipelines, deploying to the AWS cloud.
I really enjoy collaborative team environments where I can learn from others, and I have worked hard to improve my interpersonal and communication skills.
Now I am a software developer with Revature recent experience building multi-tiered web applications.
I wish I knew of Revature sooner. This place is awesome, and if you have any interest in coming, choose revature. It changed my life. I’m forever grateful to Revature for the opportunity. And I can truly say I’m happy with my life.
