I am a full-stack Java software developer with recent experience building multi-tiered web applications. 
I went to school at Texas Southern University where I pursued a Bachelor’s degree in 2019.In a few years, 
my goal is to become a senior developer so that I can mentor others.
During my time at Revature, I’ve worked on several projects where I gained experience in both backend technologies 
(including Java, SQL, Spring framework, and microservice architecture) as well as frontend development
(including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Angular).
I also have experience with DevOps and using CI/CD pipelines, deploying to the AWS cloud. 
I really enjoy collaborative team environments where I can learn from others, and 
I have worked hard to improve my interpersonal and communication skills. For my latest project. 
I look forward to applying all of my skills and prior experience in a position on your team.
